## Description

You’re what some would call a “regular person.” You don’t have super powers, and you need a hand. Maybe your cat is stuck in a tree. Perhaps you’ve got a clogged toilet… or worse… THANOS HAS APPEARED ON YOUR PLANET AND IS EXECUTING A PLAN TO DESTROY YOUR WORLD. If this is you… then you need CAPES. Capes is an app used to summon the superhero (or superheroes) of your choosing. Login (or register), describe your emergency, and select the superheroes best suited for your needs.
